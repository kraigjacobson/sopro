# Sopro TTS

> **Fork note (kraigjacobson/sopro):** this checkout adds a cosy2-compatible HTTP server, a RunPod
> serverless handler, a Dockerfile/compose and a build workflow so sopro can be a drop-in voice for
> the aitts stack. See [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md). Everything below is upstream's README.

Sopro (from the Portuguese word for "breath/blow") is a lightweight voice-cloning text-to-speech model family. This repo ships **sopro-v2-turbo**, a 120M-parameter open model that streams, runs comfortably on a laptop CPU or in the browser, and reaches SOTA-level intelligibility against much larger systems. The full story, evaluations, and audio samples are in the [blog post](https://research.haloneuro.ai/posts/sopro-v2).

Main features:

- **120M parameters**
- **English, European Portuguese, French, and German**
- **Streaming** with ~300 ms time-to-first-audio on a laptop CPU
- **Zero-shot voice cloning** from 5-20 seconds of reference audio
- **0.24 RTF offline / 0.21 RTF streaming** on an M3 CPU, 0.07 RTF on an H100
- **Runs in the browser** via an ONNX runtime

## Local demo

Run the model and open the demo with one command:

```bash
uvx --from sopro soprotts serve
```

If Sopro is already installed:

```bash
soprotts serve
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:7860. The model downloads on first use and stays in the Hugging Face cache. Sopro selects CUDA or CPU automatically and defaults to CPU on macOS (pass `--device mps` explicitly to use MPS). Use `soprotts serve --help` for model, device, port, and CPU int8 options.

## Browser demo

There is also a fully in-browser demo with no server involved: https://samuel-vitorino.github.io/sopro/. On mobile the model is quantized, so results can be slightly below the local demo, and devices with low memory may crash. The dependency-isolated ONNX runtime and exporter are documented in [`web/README.md`](web/README.md). Both demos use the frontend in [`demos/web`](demos/web).

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install -U sopro
```

### From the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuel-vitorino/sopro
cd sopro
pip install -e .
```

## Examples

### CLI

```bash
soprotts "Sopro is a lightweight 120 million parameter text-to-speech model that streams and runs on device." --ref ref.wav --out out.wav
```

Add `--stream` for the streaming path. You have the expected `--temperature`, `--top-p`, and `--top-k` parameters, alongside:

- `--lang` (`en`, `pt`, `fr`, `de`; optional, helps pronunciation on ambiguous text)
- `--int8` (int8 AR weights on CPU)
- `--steps` (acoustic solver steps; default 2). If you want to trade speed for quality, 8, 16, or even 32 steps can give higher quality speech on more challenging references
- `--max-seconds` (cap per generated segment; long text is split into segments, so total length is unbounded)

### Python

#### Non-streaming

```python
from sopro import SoproTTS

tts = SoproTTS.from_pretrained("samuel-vitorino/sopro-v2-turbo", device="cpu")

wav = tts.synthesize(
    "Hello! This is a non-streaming Sopro TTS example.",
    ref_audio_path="ref.wav",
)

tts.save_wav("out.wav", wav)
```

#### Streaming

```python
import torch
from sopro import SoproTTS

tts = SoproTTS.from_pretrained("samuel-vitorino/sopro-v2-turbo", device="cpu")

chunks = []
for chunk in tts.stream(
    "Hello! This is a streaming Sopro TTS example.",
    ref_audio_path="ref.mp3",
):
    chunks.append(chunk.cpu())

wav = torch.cat(chunks, dim=-1)
tts.save_wav("out_stream.wav", wav)
```

You can also precalculate the reference to reduce time-to-first-audio:

```python
import torch
from sopro import SoproTTS

tts = SoproTTS.from_pretrained("samuel-vitorino/sopro-v2-turbo", device="cpu")

ref = tts.prepare_reference(ref_audio_path="ref.mp3", stream=True)

chunks = []
for chunk in tts.stream(
    "Hello! This is a streaming Sopro TTS example.",
    ref=ref,
):
    chunks.append(chunk.cpu())

wav = torch.cat(chunks, dim=-1)
tts.save_wav("out_stream.wav", wav)
```

## Disclaimers

- We did not add watermarking: with an open-source inference pipeline it would be trivial to remove, so it would only provide a false sense of safety. Please use the model for good: do not impersonate people.
- The text frontend is deliberately minimal, so some abbreviations, numbers, and symbols may not be pronounced correctly. Prefer words: `1 + 2` should be written `one plus two`. That said, Sopro generally reads common abbreviations like "CPU" or "TTS" fine, and you can put a language-specific normalizer in front of it.
- Mixed-language text is a weak spot: words from one language inside a sentence of another (an English product name in a Portuguese sentence, for example) can be mispronounced.
- The streaming path (chunked attention and the causal vocoder) is not bit-exact with the offline path. For best quality, prefer the offline path.
- We are not planning to release the training code in the near future due to its complexity.
